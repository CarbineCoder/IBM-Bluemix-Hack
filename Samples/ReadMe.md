# Getting Started with Samples

This respository contains samples for IBM Bluemix (Watson, Alchemy & Cloudant) in C# & Xamarin.

## Sample submission guidelines

We welcome sample submissions. Please follow these guidelines - 

* **Folder Naming** - Always follow the API name as your sample folder name (use all small case separated by "-"(hyphens)). For e.g. for Watson Q&A use **watson-qna**
* **Screenshots** - a folder called Screenshots that has at least one screen shot of the sample (preferably a screen shot for every page or every major functionality piece, people really key off these things). 
* **Readme** - a[ README.md](http://readme.md/) file that has the name of the sample, a description, links to documentation and author attribution. 
* **Getting Started** - Please use a separate **Getting Started.md** file if you want to detail out the usage of your samples (the ones that don't fit in your ReadMe.md).
